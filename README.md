Dear,

Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used API for test App https://fakestoreapi.com.

Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in server https://fakestoreapi.com.

10 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 4.8 And Total Concurrent API requested: 290.

50 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 24 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1450.

100 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 48 And Total Concurrent API requested: 2900.

150 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 49 And Total Concurrent API requested: 4350

200 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 57 And Total Concurrent API requested: 5800

300 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 101 And Total Concurrent API requested: 8700

340 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 88 And Total Concurrent API requested: 9860

While executed 340 concurrent request, found 1 request got connection timeout and error rate is 0.32%.
Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 8700 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.
